# The first line not being a comment has to be one integer, indicating the number of
# cuboids. The following lines each contain the parameters for one cuboid.
#
# Cuboid data consists of
# * The coordinate of the lower left front-side corner (3 double values)
# * Number of particles per dimension (3 integer values)
# * Initial velocity v of the particles (3 double values)
# * Distance h of the particles (mesh width of the grid) (1 double value)
# * Mass m of one particle (1 double value)
